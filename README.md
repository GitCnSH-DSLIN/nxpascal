# nxpascal

nxPascal is a free game engine that tries to remain lightweight and portable. It is compilable under latest Lazarus on possibly all operating systems, and many Delphi versions. For now only OpenGL is supported. No android or other mobile support yet.

Forum thread for the project is at: http://www.pascalgamedevelopment.com/showthread.php?8785-nxPascal
If you wish to send me private message, you can do it there or Lazarus forums too (to User137).
