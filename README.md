# nxpascal

(Project was just moved from code.google.com, there may be some inconsistencies, such as missing wiki.)

nxPascal is a free game engine that tries to remain lightweight and portable. It is compilable under latest Lazarus on possibly all operating systems, and many Delphi versions. For now only OpenGL is supported.

Forum thread for the project is at: http://www.pascalgamedevelopment.com/showthread.php?8785-nxPascal
If you wish to send me private message, you can do it there or Lazarus forums too (to User137).
